## Translations

Translations are done on [Transifex]. You must request to join the 
team and help translate. Whenever a file is translated 100%,
a new version is created as a commmit.
- [view all commits](https://github.com/niccokunzmann/coloring-book/commits/master)
- [see example commit](https://github.com/niccokunzmann/coloring-book/commit/1b081c0d905b615f340b48bf90487dabdf09ea24)
If you do not manage to translate 100% but want to have it included
in the next release, please open an issue.
We can pull the translations then.
