## Translations

Translations are done on [Transifex]. You must request to join the 
team and help translate. Whenever a file is translated 100%, a
[pull request] will turn up with the file.
If you do not manage to translate 100% but want to have it included
in the next release, please open an issue.
We can pull the translations then.
